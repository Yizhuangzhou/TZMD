## Usage ##
1. Calculate Normalized Zvalues for query and reference genomes

perl NormalizedZvalue.pl [GenomeInfo file] [output]

[GenomeInfo file] has 8 fields, including:

 Assembly_assession\tspecies_taxid\torganism_name\tinfraspecific_name\tassembly_level\tChromosome size\tfile for Chromosome\tfile for Plasmid
 
Note: file for Chromosome: the file containing sequences in fasta format.
  
2. Calculate TZMDs and TETRAs

 perl TZMD.pl [Query NormalizedZvalue][Ref NormalizedZvalue][output]
 
 perl TETRA.pl [Query NormalizedZvalue][Ref NormalizedZvalue][output]

## Note ##
All scripts are in Bin directory, and all tested data are in Data directory.
